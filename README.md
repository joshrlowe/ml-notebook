# Machine Learning Notebook

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Notebook**. This repository contains my personal notes, explanations, and code implementations inspired by the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) offered by [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) and [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), and taught by Andrew Ng. All content is intended to demonstrate my learning process while respecting the terms and conditions of the course provider.
